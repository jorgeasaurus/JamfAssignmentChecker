## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.0 or later
- JAMF Pro server access with appropriate API permissions
- `JamfBackupRestoreFunctions.ps1` in the same directory

### Required JAMF Pro Permissions

The tool requires a JAMF Pro user account or API client with the following minimum permissions:

#### Read Permissions Required:

- **Computer Groups**: Read access to static and smart computer groups
- **Policies**: Read access to policy configuration and scope
- **macOS Configuration Profiles**: Read access to configuration profiles and scope

## Installation

1. Download both files to the same directory:
   - `JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1`
   - `JamfBackupRestoreFunctions.ps1`

2. (Optional) Copy `config.ps1.template` to `config.ps1` and configure your credentials:
   ```powershell
   cp config.ps1.template config.ps1
   # Edit config.ps1 with your JAMF Pro credentials
   ```

## Authentication

The tool supports two authentication methods:

### 1. Username/Password (Basic Auth)
```powershell
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -Server "company.jamfcloud.com" -Username "admin" -Password "password"
```

### 2. OAuth Client Credentials
```powershell
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -Server "company.jamfcloud.com" -ClientId "client_id" -ClientSecret "client_secret"
```

### 3. Configuration File
Create a `config.ps1` file in the same directory:
```powershell
$Config = @{
    BaseUrl = "company.jamfcloud.com"
    Username = "admin"
    Password = "password"
    # OR use OAuth
    ClientId = ""
    ClientSecret = ""
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Mode
Simply run the script without parameters:
```powershell
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1
```

### Command-Line Mode

#### Check Computer Assignments
```powershell
# Single computer
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -CheckComputer -ComputerNames "MacBook-001" -Server "company.jamfcloud.com" -Username "admin" -Password "pass"

# Multiple computers
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -CheckComputer -ComputerNames "MacBook-001,MacBook-002,MacBook-003"

# With CSV export
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -CheckComputer -ComputerNames "MacBook-001" -ExportToCSV -ExportPath "C:\Reports\assignments.csv"
```

#### Show All Policies
```powershell
# View all policies and their assignments
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -ShowAllPolicies

# Export to CSV

.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -FindUnassignedProfiles

# Export unassigned policies to CSV
.\JamfAssignmentChecker.ps1 -FindUnassignedPolicies -ExportToCSV -ExportPath "C:\Reports\unassigned.csv"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your credentials are correct
   - Ensure the user has the required API permissions
   - Check if your JAMF Pro server URL is correct (with or without https://)

2. **JamfBackupRestoreFunctions.ps1 not found**
   - Ensure both files are in the same directory
   - Check file permissions

3. **No assignments found**
   - Verify the computer/user/group name is correct
   - Check if the resource exists in JAMF Pro
   - Ensure you have read permissions for the resources

### Debug Mode
For troubleshooting, you can check the API responses by modifying the script's verbosity or adding debug output.
